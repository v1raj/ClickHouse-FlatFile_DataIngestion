write the code correctly and give nice snippets whats this dry fromat you have given this to me in
so clickhouse and flatfile are two separate databases having same columns?
how do i use the local docker clickhouse instance
tell me the ui logic and flow for this
code the ui of this in react and do the necessary backend calls
'docker-compose' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
what does docker do to the clickhouse instance
do docker autmoatically creates an instance of clickhouse when i create the yml file
does the clichouse instance contain multiple databases
how do i solve the data ingestion problem from flat file to clickhouse and clickhouse to  flatfile

unable to get image 'clickhouse/clickhouse-server:latest': error during connect: Get "http://%2F%2F.%2Fpipe%2FdockerDesktopLinuxEngine/v1.48/images/clickhouse/clickhouse-server:latest/json": open //./pipe/dockerDesktopLinuxEngine: The system cannot find the file specified.
ok so the clickhouse client is an object through which i can talk to the databases in the clickhouse doker
write functions for clickhouse client to fetch tables to write to flatfile after reading from clickhouse and reading from flatfile and writing to clickhouse
